    <h1>Heatnostics: A Diagnostic Framework for Raster Data</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Research Plan — Combining PDF Framework with Implementation Extensions</p>

    <!-- Abstract -->
    <div class="abstract">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditional Scagnostics (Scatterplot Diagnostics) operate on point clouds and fail to
        capture
        the grid-based, temporal, and continuous nature of heatmap data. We propose <strong>Heatnostics</strong>, a
        domain-specific
        adaptation that characterizes heatmaps using three geometric pillars: <em>Grid Support</em> (spatial
        availability),
        <em>Morse-Smale Topology</em> (signal structure), and <em>EMD Flow</em> (axis transition). This framework
        extracts
        a compact feature vector for raster data with varying completeness.

    <h3>1.1 Why These Constraints Matter</h3>

    <div class="constraint-box">
        <strong>The "Bad Statistics" Problem:</strong> Using Euclidean MST on filtered grid points causes metrics like
        "Outlying" to be biased toward 100%. This happens because the MST must connect disconnected islands of valid
        data
        with massive "super-edges," identifying almost everything as an outlier.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The Fix:</strong> Use Geodesic MSF (Minimum Spanning Forest) on the Grid Graph. If two pixels are
        adjacent
        and both valid, edge weight = |v₁ - v₂|. If separated by nulls, there is no edge. The result is a Forest
        (collection
        of trees), not a single Tree.
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: The Three Pillars -->
    <h2>2. The Three Geometric Pillars</h2>

    <p>Heatnostics uses three distinct geometric approaches, each designed to answer a different fundamental question
        about
        your data. Think of them as three different "lenses" for examining a heatmap:</p>

    <h3>I. Spatial Support — "Where is the data?"</h3>
    <div class="metric-card">
        <p><strong>Geometry Used:</strong> Alpha Shapes + Connected Components</p>

        <p><strong>What it measures:</strong> This pillar focuses on <em>data availability</em> — not the values
            themselves,
            but simply which cells have data and which don't. It treats the heatmap as a binary mask: valid cells vs.
            holes.</p>

        <p><strong>Why Alpha Shapes?</strong> An Alpha Shape is a "concave hull" — imagine shrink-wrapping the valid
            data points.
            Unlike a convex hull (which draws a rubber band around all points), an alpha shape follows the actual
            boundary of the data,
            including concave indentations. This lets us accurately measure holes <em>inside</em> the data region, not
            just empty
            space around it.</p>

        <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> Imagine looking at a road survey map. Some segments were surveyed, some
            weren't.
            Spatial Support tells you: "What percentage of the highway was actually measured? Are the gaps scattered
            randomly or
            concentrated in one area? Is the data fragmented into disconnected islands?"</p>

        <p><strong>Key metrics:</strong> Porosity (hole ratio), Fragmentation (island count), Diagonal Connectivity
            (connection pattern)</p>
    </div>

    <h3>II. Signal Topology — "What patterns exist in the values?"</h3>
    <div class="metric-card">
        <p><strong>Geometry Used:</strong> Morse-Smale Complex + Statistical Moments</p>

        <p><strong>What it measures:</strong> This pillar focuses on the <em>actual values</em> in the heatmap — the
            "terrain"
            of the data. It finds local peaks (high spots), valleys (low spots), and the ridges/valleys connecting them.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why Morse-Smale?</strong> Morse theory treats your heatmap as a 3D terrain where the Z-axis is the
            cell value.
            Just like a topographic map has mountain peaks, valley floors, and saddle points (passes between mountains),
            your heatmap
            has critical points. The Morse-Smale complex partitions the entire heatmap into regions that "flow" to the
            same
            peak and valley pairs.</p>

        <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> For highway condition data, a "peak" is a segment in excellent
            condition,
            a "valley" is a damaged segment. The number of peaks tells you if you have many scattered good spots or one
            large
            good region. The skewness (Distress Intensity) tells you if your road is "mostly good with a few potholes"
            or
            "uniformly mediocre."</p>

        <p><strong>Key metrics:</strong> Peaks/Valleys (critical point count), Distress Intensity (skewness), Error
            Noise (oscillation detection)</p>
    </div>

    <h3>III. Axis Transition — "How does data change along one axis?"</h3>
    <div class="metric-card">
        <p><strong>Geometry Used:</strong> Earth Mover's Distance (Optimal Transport)</p>

        <p><strong>What it measures:</strong> This pillar focuses on <em>transitions along one axis</em> of the heatmap.
            It asks: "How much does the data distribution change as we move along axis A? Is there a directional trend?"
            This works for <strong>both time-based and variable-based</strong> heatmaps.</p>

        <p><strong>Why Earth Mover's Distance?</strong> EMD (also called Wasserstein distance) measures the minimum
            "work"
            needed to transform one distribution into another. Imagine each row (or column) as a pile of dirt. EMD asks:
            "How much dirt do I need to move to reshape row N into row N+1?" This captures
            both the <em>magnitude</em> of change (flux) and the <em>direction</em> of change (drift).</p>

        <p><strong>For time axis:</strong> Low flux = stable over years. Positive drift = deteriorating. Negative drift
            = improving.</p>

        <p><strong>For variable axis:</strong> Low flux = smooth gradient along the variable. High flux = abrupt
            changes.
            Drift indicates whether values tend to increase or decrease along that axis.</p>

        <p><strong>Key metrics:</strong> Transition Flux (change magnitude), Drift (change direction)</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Metric Definitions -->
    <h2>3. Metric Definitions</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Spatial Support Metrics</h3>
    <p>These metrics measure <strong>data availability</strong> — where data exists, what's missing, and how coverage is
        structured.</p>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Porosity <span class="status-done">[Implemented]</span></h4>
        <code class="formula">Porosity = Hole_Area / Alpha_Shape_Area</code>
        <p>Measures the fraction of missing data <em>inside</em> the concave boundary of valid cells. Unlike simple
            sparsity,
            porosity only counts holes within the data region, not empty space around it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Range:</strong> 0 to 1</li>
            <li><strong>0</strong> = Full grid, no holes</li>
            <li><strong>0.3</strong> = 30% "Swiss cheese" pattern</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Detect missing survey coverage</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Fragmentation <span class="status-done">[Implemented]</span></h4>
        <code class="formula">Fragmentation = Count of 8-connected components</code>
        <p>Counts how many disconnected islands of valid data exist using 8-connected flood fill (including diagonal
            neighbors).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Range:</strong> 1 to N</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> = Single connected region</li>
            <li><strong>High</strong> = Scattered islands of data</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Identify severe data gaps</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Diagonal Connectivity <span class="status-done">[Implemented — Extension]</span></h4>
        <code
            class="formula">DiagonalConn = (Components_4connected - Components_8connected) / Components_4connected</code>
        <p>Measures reliance on diagonal-only connections by comparing 4-connectivity vs 8-connectivity. Detects
            "checkerboard"
            gap patterns that row-wise methods miss.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Range:</strong> 0 to 1</li>
            <li><strong>0</strong> = Well-connected (no diagonal reliance)</li>
            <li><strong>High</strong> = Checkerboard pattern, sparse grid</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Irregular/sparse raster grids</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Solidity <span class="status-next">[Next Phase]</span></h4>
        <code class="formula">Solidity = Valid_Pixels / Convex_Hull_Area</code>
        <p>Ratio of actual valid pixels to convex hull area. Low solidity indicates irregular boundary with concave
            regions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Tortuosity <span class="status-next">[Next Phase]</span></h4>
        <code class="formula">Tortuosity = Perimeter² / (4π × Area)</code>
        <p>Measures boundary complexity. A circle has tortuosity = 1. Higher values indicate fractal-like coastlines.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>3.2 Signal Topology Metrics</h3>
    <p>These metrics measure <strong>value distribution</strong> — patterns, local extrema, and statistical properties.
    </p>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Peaks & Valleys (Morse-Smale) <span class="status-done">[Implemented]</span></h4>
        <code class="formula">Peaks = Count of local maxima (all neighbors have lower values)<br>
Valleys = Count of local minima (all neighbors have higher values)</code>
        <p>Identifies critical points in the value surface using Morse-Smale theory. For highway data: peaks = good
            condition areas, valleys = damage hotspots.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Many peaks</strong> = Multiple distinct hotspots</li>
            <li><strong>Few peaks</strong> = Smooth, uniform surface</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Find localized problem areas</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Distress Intensity <span class="status-done">[Implemented — Extension]</span></h4>
        <code class="formula">Distress Intensity = Skewness(all_scores) = E[(X - μ)³] / σ³</code>
        <p>Measures asymmetry of score distribution. Differentiates "uniformly mediocre" roads from "mostly good with
            severe potholes."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Negative skew</strong> = Tail towards low scores (damage hotspots)</li>
            <li><strong>Positive skew</strong> = Tail towards high scores (isolated good spots)</li>
            <li><strong>Zero</strong> = Symmetric distribution</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Characterize damage patterns</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Error Noise <span class="status-done">[Implemented — Extension]</span></h4>
        <code class="formula">Error Noise = Oscillations / (N - 2)<br>
where Oscillation = sign change in (v[i] - v[i-1]) vs (v[i+1] - v[i])</code>
        <p>Measures high-frequency oscillations. Counts how often values alternate up-down-up along each row. High rates
            suggest
            sensor errors rather than real physical changes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Range:</strong> 0 to 1</li>
            <li><strong>0</strong> = Smooth, monotonic data</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> = Maximum oscillation (pure noise)</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Flag suspicious data quality</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="metric-card">
        <h4>Roughness <span class="status-next">[Next Phase]</span></h4>
        <code class="formula">Roughness = Surface_Area_3D / Footprint_Area_2D</code>
        <p>Treats heatmap as 3D surface. High roughness = volatile local changes.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>3.3 Axis Transition Metrics</h3>
    <p>These metrics measure <strong>distribution changes along one axis</strong>. The framework supports two
        directions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Row-to-row:</strong> Compare distribution of each row to the next</li>
        <li><strong>Column-to-column:</strong> Compare distribution of each column to the next</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="constraint-box">
        <strong>Why no diagonal transitions?</strong><br><br>
        Unlike spatial connectivity (which uses 8-connected neighbors for adjacency), EMD compares entire
        row/column distributions — not individual cell pairs. Diagonal transitions are excluded for three reasons:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Unclear semantics:</strong> Diagonal mixes two axes simultaneously (e.g., "time AND position"),
                making interpretation confusing.</li>
            <li><strong>Redundant information:</strong> Diagonal transitions decompose into row + column transitions.
                Measuring them separately provides cleaner, more interpretable results.</li>
            <li><strong>Anisotropic data:</strong> When axes represent different types (time vs. space, directed vs.
                undirected),
                mixing them in a diagonal obscures the distinct dynamics of each axis.</li>
        </ol>
        For isotropic data (both axes same type, e.g., lat × lon), diagonal analysis could detect directional texture
        patterns — but this is a specialized extension, not part of the core framework.

    <h2>7. Related Work</h2>

    <p>This section surveys the research landscape that informs and motivates Heatnostics. We organize our review into
        six threads: (1) scagnostics and its extensions, (2) topological data analysis for scalar fields, (3) optimal
        transport and distribution comparison, (4) texture analysis in image processing, (5) infrastructure condition
        monitoring, and (6) handling missing data in raster visualization. We conclude by positioning Heatnostics at the
        intersection of these threads, addressing gaps that none individually fills.</p>

    <h3>7.1 Scagnostics: Origins and Extensions</h3>
    <p>The term "scagnostics" (scatterplot diagnostics) was coined by John and Paul Tukey in 1985, though a formal
        computational framework was not developed until Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman's 2005 IEEE InfoVis paper [1].
        Their approach constructs geometric graphs—Delaunay triangulation, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and alpha
        hulls—from scatterplot point coordinates, then extracts nine metrics: <em>Outlying</em>, <em>Skewed</em>,
        <em>Clumpy</em>, <em>Sparse</em>, <em>Striated</em>, <em>Convex</em>, <em>Skinny</em>, <em>Stringy</em>, and
        <em>Monotonic</em>. These metrics enable automated navigation of large scatterplot matrices, guiding analysts
        toward "interesting" variable pairs without exhaustive manual inspection.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Extensions and Applications.</strong> Since 2005, scagnostics have been extended in several directions.
        Dang et al. [2] introduced ScagExplorer, an interactive system for exploring high-dimensional data using
        scagnostics as a lens for dimension reduction. Lehmann et al. [3] extended scagnostics to 3D point clouds,
        developing nD scagnostics that characterize data in higher-dimensional spaces—useful for guiding clustering or
        outlier detection in spaces beyond visualization limits. Recent work has integrated scagnostics with deep
        learning:
        convolutional neural networks can now estimate scagnostics scores from scatterplot images, enabling real-time
        classification at scale [4]. The ScagnosticsJS library provides browser-based implementations supporting 2D, 3D,
        and higher-dimensional computations [3].</p>

    <p><strong>Limitations for Heatmaps.</strong> Despite their utility, scagnostics are fundamentally designed for
        point clouds in continuous Euclidean space. Three assumptions fail when applied to raster heatmaps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Euclidean proximity:</strong> Scagnostics use Euclidean distance for graph construction, but heatmap
            cells have discrete lattice adjacency—a cell is "near" its 4 or 8 neighbors, regardless of value.</li>
        <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Scagnostics assume all data points exist. Heatmaps often have systematic gaps
            (null cells) that carry semantic meaning—a sensor was offline, a survey was incomplete.</li>
        <li><strong>Static analysis:</strong> Standard scagnostics treat data as a single snapshot. Temporal heatmaps
            (rows = time) require transition-aware metrics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Heatnostics addresses these gaps by replacing Euclidean primitives with grid-native structures, treating nulls as
        topological features, and introducing axis transition metrics.</p>

    <h3>7.2 Topological Data Analysis and Scalar Field Visualization</h3>
    <p>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides mathematical tools for characterizing the "shape" of data. For scalar
        fields—functions assigning values to points in space—Morse theory [5] serves as the foundational framework.
        Morse theory analyzes a field through its <strong>critical points</strong>: locations where the gradient
        vanishes
        (maxima, minima, saddles). The topology of level sets changes only at critical points, making them natural
        features for segmentation and summarization.</p>

    <p><strong>Morse-Smale Complexes.</strong> The Morse-Smale (MS) complex partitions a domain into regions sharing
        common gradient flow behavior—cells connected to the same maximum and minimum [6]. Edelsbrunner et al. [7]
        formalized hierarchical MS complexes for piecewise-linear 2-manifolds. Gyulassy et al. [8] developed efficient
        algorithms for computing MS complexes on 3D scalar fields, enabling applications in combustion simulation [9]
        and climate modeling. Discrete Morse theory, introduced by Forman [10], extends these concepts to combinatorial
        structures like meshes and grids, making them applicable to digital images.</p>

    <p><strong>Persistence and Robustness.</strong> Persistence diagrams [11] quantify the "lifetime" of topological
        features across scales, filtering noise from significant structure. A peak that persists across many threshold
        levels is more significant than one that appears and disappears quickly. This robustness to localized noise is
        essential for real-world data with measurement errors.</p>

    <p><strong>Applications in Visualization.</strong> TDA has been applied to terrain analysis (watershed
        segmentation),
        medical imaging (tumor detection), materials science (pore structure analysis), and astrophysics (cosmic web
        characterization). Our Peaks and Valleys metrics adapt critical point counting for discrete heatmaps, while
        future work on Roughness and persistence-based filtering will further leverage TDA concepts.</p>

    <h3>7.3 Optimal Transport and Distribution Comparison</h3>
    <p>Optimal Transport (OT) theory, originating with Monge (1781) and formalized by Kantorovich (1942), provides a
        principled framework for comparing probability distributions. The <strong>Earth Mover's Distance</strong> (EMD),
        also known as the 1-Wasserstein distance, measures the minimum "work" (mass × distance) required to transform
        one distribution into another [12]. Unlike divergences (KL, JS), EMD is a true metric satisfying the triangle
        inequality, and it provides an interpretable transport plan—which parts of the source distribution map to which
        parts of the target.</p>

    <p><strong>Applications.</strong> Rubner et al. [13] pioneered EMD for image retrieval, showing it outperformed
        histogram intersection for matching perceptually similar images. In machine learning, OT underpins domain
        adaptation [14] and generative modeling (Wasserstein GANs). Peyré and Cuturi [15] provide a comprehensive survey
        of computational optimal transport, including entropic regularization for scalable approximations.</p>

    <p><strong>Temporal Change Detection.</strong> For time series and temporal data, OT-based methods detect
        "change points" where the underlying distribution shifts significantly [16]. This non-parametric approach makes
        no assumptions about distribution shape, detecting both abrupt transitions and gradual drifts. Applications
        include financial anomaly detection, ECG monitoring, and human activity recognition.</p>

    <p><strong>Heatnostics Application.</strong> Our Transition Flux metric computes EMD between consecutive rows (or
        columns) of a heatmap, capturing global redistribution patterns across the axis. The Drift metric—signed CDF
        integral—adds directionality, distinguishing improvement from deterioration in infrastructure contexts.</p>

    <h3>7.4 Texture Analysis in Image Processing</h3>
    <p>Texture analysis characterizes spatial patterns in images beyond simple statistics. Haralick et al. [17]
        introduced the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), computing joint probabilities of pixel intensity pairs
        at specified offsets. From GLCM, features like Contrast, Correlation, Energy (uniformity), and Homogeneity
        describe whether texture is smooth, structured, or chaotic. GLCM has been widely adopted in remote sensing
        (land use classification), medical imaging (tumor grading), and materials science (surface quality).</p>

    <p><strong>Minkowski Functionals.</strong> For binary or thresholded images, Minkowski functionals—area, perimeter,
        and Euler characteristic—provide morphological descriptors rooted in integral geometry [18]. These have been
        applied to cosmology (galaxy distribution), porous media analysis, and defect detection in manufacturing.</p>

    <p><strong>Limitations for Sparse Data.</strong> Both GLCM and Minkowski functionals assume complete images. When
        applied to sparse grids with missing data, they either fail (undefined co-occurrences) or produce biased
        estimates (treating nulls as a "color"). Heatnostics adapts these concepts for sparse contexts: Porosity
        quantifies holes using alpha shapes rather than pixel counting; planned Contrast metrics will compute GLCM
        only over valid cell pairs.</p>

    <h3>7.5 Infrastructure Condition Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Pavement management systems (PMS) form a critical application domain for Heatnostics. Road agencies worldwide
        collect condition data—Pavement Condition Index (PCI), International Roughness Index (IRI), distress surveys—
        organized as spatial (location along highway) and temporal (year of survey) grids [19]. Deterioration modeling
        predicts future conditions using Markov chains, survival analysis, or machine learning [20].</p>

    <p><strong>Data Quality Challenges.</strong> Real pavement data exhibits systematic sparsity: segments are surveyed
        on rotating schedules, sensors fail, weather disrupts collection. Traditional analyses impute missing values or
        exclude incomplete records, losing information about the missingness pattern itself. For agencies, knowing
        <em>where</em> data is missing—and whether gaps are random or systematic—is as important as the condition
        scores themselves.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Spatial-Temporal Analysis.</strong> Geographic Information Systems (GIS) enable spatial visualization
        and analysis of pavement data [21]. Machine learning approaches increasingly incorporate spatial structure,
        recognizing that adjacent segments deteriorate similarly due to shared traffic and climate [22]. Graph Neural
        Networks have been applied to road networks, propagating information along connectivity structure.</p>

    <p><strong>Heatnostics Contribution.</strong> For infrastructure monitoring, Heatnostics provides domain-agnostic
        summary statistics that complement traditional condition indices. Porosity quantifies survey completeness;
        Fragmentation identifies disconnected monitored regions; Drift tracks whether conditions are improving or
        deteriorating systemically, not just locally.</p>

    <h3>7.6 Missing Data in Raster Visualization</h3>
    <p>Missing data (NoData cells) in raster datasets arises from sensor failures, processing errors, cloud cover in
        satellite imagery, or intentional survey design [23]. GIS tools provide imputation methods—inverse distance
        weighting, kriging, neighbor-based filling—that estimate missing values from surrounding cells. These are
        appropriate when the goal is producing complete surfaces for analysis, but they obscure information about
        the spatial pattern of missingness [24].</p>

    <p><strong>Missing Data as Information.</strong> In some contexts, the pattern of missingness carries semantic
        meaning. In infrastructure monitoring, a gap may indicate construction (section closed for work),
        administrative boundaries (different agency jurisdictions), or systematic data collection failures (equipment
        deployed only in certain weather). Imputing these gaps erases this information; visualizing them as "holes"
        preserves it.</p>

    <p><strong>Heatnostics Approach.</strong> Rather than imputing missing values, Heatnostics treats nulls as
        first-class topological features. The alpha shape bounds valid data; holes within this boundary are counted
        and measured. Porosity, Fragmentation, and Diagonal Connectivity all characterize the <em>structure</em> of
        availability, not just the presence of gaps. This aligns with cartographic best practices for uncertainty
        visualization [25] and enables downstream analysis to account for data provenance.</p>

    <p>By synthesizing graph-theoretic diagnostics from scagnostics, critical point analysis from TDA, distribution
        comparison from optimal transport, and domain semantics from infrastructure monitoring, Heatnostics provides
        a unified framework for characterizing sparse, temporal raster data. The key innovations are: (1) treating
        nulls as topological features rather than data quality issues; (2) using grid-native 8-connectivity rather
        than Euclidean proximity; and (3) supporting both row and column axis transitions through EMD-based metrics.</p>
